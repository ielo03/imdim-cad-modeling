= design

plan:

1. get database of OpenSCAD models, render 2d images of them
1. train on images of the models
1. generate from model
1. loop:
  1. prompt user for contstraints / more images
  1. run checker

brute force after generation to fit constraints

how does ruler in slicer work (this will be how we determine if the model is "correct")
